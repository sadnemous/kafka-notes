✨ Epic Southern Utah Roadtrip Itinerary — from a Southwest Local ⬇️
Planning a trip to the Southwest this year? I’ve traveled all over Utah for the last 10 years, and if I was planning one epic road trip to see the Mighty Five, this is exactly what I would do. This itinerary hits all the major parks and takes you through some of the best the state has to offer.
The best part about this itinerary? It’s accessible from Las Vegas or Salt Lake City. Ideally, you’ll need 10-14 days to hit not only the best of each park, but to make sure you have time for other amazing areas around Southern Utah.

beat the heat at this natural water park in Sedona, AZ! @sliderockstatepark
rated as one of America’s top 10 best swimming holes, this beautiful park offers natural water slides, cliff jumping, and is fun for the whole family.
Slide Rock State Park charges an entrance fee of $20 per vehicle on weekdays and $30 on weekends. from the parking lot, it is around a 5-10 minute walk to reach the water area. be cautious as some spots are slippery and it’s easy to loose your footing. dogs aren’t allowed near the water area.
there are restrooms available on site and also a little market to purchase ice cream, drinks and other snacks. it does get fairly crowded but there are still plenty of places to find a spot to sit and relax.
don’t forget to bring plenty of water and sun protection, pack out your trasn and belongings ano be mindful of other visitors.
